the job steam name is also pulling in the select set name and the job stream name so the NCOA will be in the file name multiple times . I will change the noca_non to NCOA-NON . this is what we discussed: cdsset_ncoa-A1_(instance)_(###)_date/time stamp .

I think this should work. it just needs to be consistent across all file names . the file name is also pulling in the select set name and the job stream name . I will change the noca_non to NCOA-NON . cds-global.com: 'i'm not sure if the job steam name is generic across the board'

when testing on the RU-ACC, I am not seeing any missed issues populating .

Rob Nutt Technical Client Consultant CDS Global 1901 Bell Avenue Des Moines, IA 50315 . he has the CC2 instance configured to allow for missed issues . the replacement issue parameter is set to 1 per the client instructions . I am guessing either we don't have missed issues loaded on RU-ACC at all, or possibly the CORE policies differ in how many replacements they can request?

issue table blanks RU won't have back issues . if a subscriber needs a replacement, this will go through the PRO system . CIR orders do not allow for true one off missed/damaged issues (P=PRO does). X should not be used ever, because neither CIR or PRO processes can pull this Source into the jobs.

RU- Global Care, issue table blanks I'm just leaving, can send them over this weekend so you can have them at start of the day Monday . if we run selections to close to each other, you won't get great counts . I'll send all of those at the same time while working on some deals for our SMC campaign if you want to look into those selections as well .

Isaiah's team can request a setup/configuration by the test team (Jacob) when testing is done it can be verified by either the dev team or Isaiah’s team – depending on the test (i.e. trigger based email vs batch email) but I am fine if between dev and test team leads, they determine who will update test status .

newrepublic.com is not going to be submitting transactions all the way through, so I only check that it is displaying all of the options it should for the kind of account it is, and if not, figure out why . but since these instances don't mirror each other for settings, and each has to be configured separately, I am planning on testing (when a client has both a sandbox and prod) production .

the AMB410 was running as a stand-alone after EOD and EOM at like 12:30am . it's not running in that instance either but it’s not part of EOD in that either . I'm doing some investigation into it now, restarting the process to see if it was a one off error .

we use the first three positions of the Itemnumber> tag . you are now asking us to create a translation table for The new Republic only . when you start making exceptions, it will cause issues in the future . the same log and IMB MID since it is one title .

the RU-NUD is a valid item number (access service), module of ATM . it automatically populates as a line item with every digital order . you are now asking us to create a translation table for The New Republic only . when you start making exceptions, it will cause issues in the future .

RU-NUD is a valid item number (access service), module of ATM . it automatically populates as a line item with every digital order . if the module is ATM, can you have the item number blanked out if it's ATM?

RU- is not valid for us. we want to create a standard across all clients . if this field is blank, then we use the default that has been set up . this seems to be only an issue with the digital module (ATM) RU (new Republic) Refunds No, because that item is a component of the package .

all clients that have packages will have agreement access that will be the instance name + dash, RU- . can you just resort to the default if it does not have a 3-position match . if this field is blank, then we use the default that has been set up .

if this allows us to have more accurate counts this is something we should be sharing and implementing as a best practice across the board . for the first bullet point, I'm creating select sets similar to Corey's so that I can get a more accurate count of Dry runs one day ahead each time allowing Nevzeta to see less discrepancy between counts .

the count on the Core reports show 216 and we created more bills because each needs to be separate on back end . the agreement numbers are 209680 and 2096 . they have 2 unpaid agreements which create 2 bills . a new record in mailout for each agreement, we have too?

I have yet to make it to any of the team specific instances . if it’d be more beneficial for whoever would schedule wf rules for each instance, then I can pass up those instances, otherwise, I can update all .

Scott and Curt have added comments/rules to the ticket . I guess I may be at sort of a loss, but maybe this is then taken care of or I need someone to help me understand what is still outstanding . i know Kris setup much of the taxation rules . but, that's as far as my knowledge goes .

we'd have to set up three separate schedules to accommodate the 11:00 pm end time of the production maintenance that happens once a month . the second would be at 11:15 pm on the first, second, fourth and last Thursdays of the month The third would be on the third, second and fourth Thursdays . I really don't think we want to have three schedules and should just look at moving the EOD back to an 11.15 pm run time across the board.
